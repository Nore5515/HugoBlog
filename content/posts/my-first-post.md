Starting Out
======

23/01/20

Well, after a long week and a half, I finally have this blog up and running. Hopefully. I'm not entirely sure if this will work, but I'm remaining optimistic, as I have for the past 10 days or so.

This blog is hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and through using them I realized I had forgotten practically everything I had ever known about git. It took me almost an entire day, but I relearned some git commands, including, but not limited to:

- Pulling, committing and pushing to and from a repo
- Setting upstream, head, branches, SSH-keys and forks
- Merging, and fixing said merge errors
- __S u b m o d u l e s__

Submodules gave me a hard time. I persisted, I emerged victorious, but I left that experience a different person than when I went in.

The blog itself is using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for its framework, and I must admit, I've grown rather fond of it. It's a static site generator, which is why I'm hosting it on github pages right now, and runs incredibly quickly with some very user friendly commands. However, I struggled a lot with getting it to work with Github Pages. Following the Hugo to Github Pages tutorial (posted [here](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)), I ran into a lot of issues getting Hugo's public folder to be its own submodule, but eventually (with some help) got it fixed.

Another nice thing about Hugo is it's wide selection of easy to use themes! I'm using [Paper CSS](https://themes.gohugo.io/papercss-hugo-theme/) right now, and I'm pleased to say that it gave me no trouble whatsoever when I was adding it.

I learned a lot through this whole experience, specifically about web dev, something I've never touched in the past (the most experience I had with this sort of thing was a 3 hour HTML course in middle school. I spent two of those three hours playing [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) on the school computers). With some new experience in hand, I'm excited to start creating and developing more and more web stuff. All in all, things are looking up!
